## 🏆 Wrestling My Way Through Life

I used to wrestle a lot (high school record: **76-20**)! I even placed 2nd at MAWA Eastern Nationals (shoutout to anyone who knows what that is). Unfortunately, Covid stole my chance to compete my senior season, but I’m retired now and channeling the same passion and resilience I brought to wrestling into my journey as a developer.

## 👁️‍🗨️ My Perspective

I am also legally blind. This drives me to do something great—I’ve learned life isn’t always sweet, but every challenge is part of my testimony and my motivation to build a better world through code.

## 🔧 Always Learning

- Currently learning **Vim motions** (on the path to becoming a nonchalant **NeoVim** user 🧙‍♂️)
- Always excited to explore new tech and contribute to interesting projects!
